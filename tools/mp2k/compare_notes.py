"""Check a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against the game's MP2K sound driver, note by note.

    compare_notes.py ROM FOLDER [--songs 0-22] [--frames 12000] [-j JOBS]

FOLDER holds supergbamidi's conversion of ROM: NAME_NN.mid and NAME_NN.sf2 for each song, or NAME_mp2k_NN.mid and
NAME_mp2k_NN.sf2 if detection finds another of the game's drivers first. For every song, the driver runs under
driver_emu.py for as long as the MIDI file lasts and two frames more, and each note it starts is matched with a MIDI
note on the MIDI channel of its track, with the same key, that starts within a frame and a half of it. For each pair,
the script checks:

  - the velocity, and the track's volume when the note starts;
  - the sound: the SoundFont zone that the note's program and key choose has to play the driver's sample, square
    wave duty, wave pattern or noise type. Track 9 plays on the drum channel, so its zones come from bank 128;
  - the pitch on every frame of the note until its release, from the zone's root key, tuning and sample rate and the
    channel's pitch bend, against the driver's rate for a sample, or its frequency setting for a PSG channel, which can
    be two steps of the 11-bit register from equal temperament;
  - the release, which has to come within a frame and a half of the MIDI note's end, unless the MIDI note ends where
    the key starts again, or the file ends before the driver releases the note.

A MIDI note that the driver doesn't play, or a driver note that the MIDI file doesn't have, counts as a difference. A
driver note that starts in the file's last half frame or after it is left out, since it can be the loop starting again.
MIDI events land on their own ticks, where the driver plays them on the frame whose ticks reach them, so a difference of
a frame and a half either way is allowed. A song named in --songs that has no MIDI file mustn't play any notes.
