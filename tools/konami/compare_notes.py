"""Compare supergbamidi's MIDI files and SoundFonts with the game's driver, note by note.

    compare_notes.py ROM SUPERGBAMIDI FOLDER [--songs 0-22]

FOLDER holds SUPERGBAMIDI's conversion of ROM: NAME_NN.mid and NAME_NN.sf2
for song NN, or NAME_konami_NN.mid and NAME_konami_NN.sf2 if another driver
was detected first. Events in these MIDI files follow the song's beat and
may be up to a frame and a half from the driver's timing. The script
converts ROM again with --frame-timing to keep events on the driver's
frames. Both conversions must have identical SoundFonts and the same notes,
keys, programs, controller changes and pitch bends, in the same order on
each channel and within 1.65 frames of each other: a frame and a half, and
the rounding of a tick. An event that gives a controller, pitch bend or
program the value it already has, as the conversions do where a loop starts,
isn't compared. For each song, it then runs the driver under driver_emu.py
for the duration of the --frame-timing MIDI file. On every frame, it
compares the driver's DirectSound voice records and PSG registers with what
that MIDI file plays through its SoundFont:

* Notes start and stop on exactly the frames where the driver starts and stops
  a voice or channel. A voice or channel that the MIDI file has no track for
  has to be silent in the driver, and each track with notes has to stand for
  a different voice or channel of the driver. Where every write of a square
  channel restarts it, as in AYDE, a PSG note can also start on any frame that
  writes its channel.
* A sample note plays the driver's sample, with the same data and loop, at the
  driver's pitch. The driver's pitch is a whole number of steps, so a
  difference of up to two steps (a few cents) is allowed. Where a FIFO plays
  its voices at its timer's rate, as in AYDE, the difference can be 2 cents.
* A PSG note plays the driver's duty cycle, wave RAM image or noise setting,
  within one step of the frequency register the driver wrote.
* CC10 and CC11 give the driver's level on each side to within 1.5 dB, and
  CC91 follows the driver's echo routing, which PSG channels aren't part of.

supergbamidi writes no MIDI file for a song with no notes. If
`SUPERGBAMIDI --info` lists a song missing from FOLDER, the driver must be
silent for its reported duration.

It prints the first 10 differences in each song and the largest pitch and level
deviations, and exits with status 1 if anything differs.
