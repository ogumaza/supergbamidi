"""Run a Konami GBA sound driver's code under the Unicorn ARM emulator.

This is the reference for checking supergbamidi. It calls the driver's
init, song-start and per-frame routines directly (no BIOS, no video), and
captures what the driver produces:

    trace       the per-frame track output records, in `supergbamidi --trace` format
    render-ds   the DirectSound output (FIFO A = right and FIFO B = left, or both on both sides in the games whose
                drivers say so)
    render-psg  the PSG, rendered by psg_model.py from the driver's register writes

    driver_emu.py ROM trace SONG FRAMES
    driver_emu.py ROM render-ds SONG FRAMES OUT.wav [--voices 0,3] [--echo]
    driver_emu.py ROM render-psg SONG FRAMES OUT.wav [--channel N]

The routine and RAM addresses are chosen by the ROM's game code. Those of
