Test songs for the WCT 2004 revision (BYWP), the Rave Master revision (BRME), the Eternal Duelist revision (AY5E and
AYWE) and the Dungeon Dice Monsters revision (AYDE) are built in.

In the WCT 2004 and Rave Master songs, square 1 has an attack and a decay, vibrato, a bend and pans that make it take
square 2 for its left side. The wave channel plays with vibrato, changes waves and bends a note, which reloads wave 0.
The noise channel plays two notes, voice 0 calls a fragment of its own data both ways and runs the commands that do
nothing, voice 1 loops the song from its loop point, and voice 2 pans itself. In WCT 2004, voice 2 also sets the echo up
and routes voice 1 to echo bus 0.

In the Eternal Duelist song, square 1 plays legato notes that take it more than 24 semitones from the note it started,
and sets NR51 bits for square 2 as well as its own. The wave channel's legato note and bend reload wave 0, and the noise
channel plays a legato note too. Voice 0 calls a fragment both ways, turns vibrato on and off with F4 and FC, and runs
commands that do nothing until the driver's leftover call count takes it back after the second call. Voices 1 and 3 set
the next voice's volume, and voice 1 loops the song, which resets square 1's pan. Vibrato and a bend wipe out the starts
of two of voice 2's notes.

In the Dungeon Dice Monsters song, square 1 sets NR50, bends, plays vibrato at depth 6, restarts, sets a volume without
a note, releases one note and rests with FB during vibrato, and stops the song. Square 2 calls a fragment with F4 and
F5 until the driver's leftover call count takes it back after the second call. The wave channel loads a wave while a
note plays, plays legato notes at the four volume codes, and loads another wave through F5. The noise channel plays a
note of the square table and a sample note on voice 0. Voices 0 and 2 play notes of their samples at other rates and
bend them, while the other voice of their FIFO is silent, and voice 2 plays voice 3's notes, the second at volume 0.
