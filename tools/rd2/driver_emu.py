"""Run Nintendo R&D2's GBA sound driver under the Unicorn ARM emulator.

This is the reference for checking supergbamidi's model of the driver. It calls the game's sound init, the
driver's routine that asks for a sequence, and the driver's per-frame routines (no video and no interrupts; the BIOS
calls the driver makes are emulated), and captures what the driver does:

    trace       each voice's state after each frame, and the writes to the PSG's registers, in the format of
                supergbamidi --trace
    dump        the players and tracks in use after a number of frames
    render      the mixer's output, the samples the driver sends to the FIFOs, as a WAV file at the mixer's rate
                (the PSG isn't rendered)

    driver_emu.py ROM trace SEQUENCE FRAMES
    driver_emu.py ROM dump SEQUENCE FRAMES
    driver_emu.py ROM render SEQUENCE FRAMES OUT.wav

The routine and RAM addresses are chosen by the ROM's game code. Those of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
(AZLE) and Super Mario Advance 2 (AA2E) are built in. Another game needs its own values; see GAMES and docs/rd2.md.
