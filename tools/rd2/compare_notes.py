"""Check a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against the game's driver, note by note.

    compare_notes.py ROM SUPERGBAMIDI FOLDER [--songs 0-33] [--frames 12000]

FOLDER holds supergbamidi's conversion of ROM: NAME_NN.mid and NAME_NN.sf2 for each sequence, or NAME_rd2_NN.mid and
NAME_rd2_NN.sf2 if detection finds another of the game's drivers first. For every sequence, the driver runs under
driver_emu.py for as long as the MIDI file lasts, with hooks in its note on routine, and each note it starts with a
voice has to be in the MIDI file, and the other way round:

  - on its track's channel, with the key and velocity the conversion gives it, starting within the frame the driver
    starts it in or the frame before (a MIDI note keeps to its own tick, where the driver waits for the next frame);
  - ending within a frame of the driver's release or stop of its voice, or where the MIDI file has to end it early:
    at its end, or where the channel plays the key again;
  - with a SoundFont zone for its key that plays the driver's sample at the pitch the driver plays the note at, to
    within a cent, or a square, wave or noise voice's sound;
  - and in each frame that its voice is the newest of its track's, with the pitch bend for the voice's pitch in that
    frame, which slides, the track's bend and the LFO change.

A sequence named in --songs that has no MIDI file mustn't play any notes. SUPERGBAMIDI is used for its --info report,
which names the driver's tables and gives each sequence's length.
