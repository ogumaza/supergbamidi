# Research and validation tools

These Python scripts run a game's sound driver from a ROM you supply. Use
them to study the drivers or check a change to `supergbamidi` against the
game's code. They aren't needed for conversion.

Setup (Python 3.10 or later):

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate        # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

`compare_audio.py` also needs `ffmpeg`, and rendering a MIDI file for comparison
needs a SoundFont player such as `fluidsynth`.

These scripts in `tools/` serve more than one driver:

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `gbarom.py` | loads a `.gba` ROM or a GSF rip; used by the other scripts |
| `gbadis.py` | recursive-descent Thumb/ARM disassembler that resolves literal pools, marks code a GSF rip has zeroed out, and can read code at the address the game copies it to |
| `psg_model.py` | Game Boy APU model that renders a driver's PSG register writes to audio |
| `conversion.py` | finds a driver's MIDI files in a folder of `supergbamidi`'s output, and compares a conversion on the song's beat with one made with `--frame-timing`; used by the `compare_notes.py` scripts |

A conversion includes songs from every driver found in the game. Files from
drivers other than the first include the driver's name. The `compare_trace.py`
scripts, and the `compare_notes.py` scripts apart from Rare's and MP2K's, run
`supergbamidi` with `--driver`. Each `compare_notes.py` checks only its
driver's files.

Driver-specific scripts are in `tools/konami/`, `tools/rare/`, `tools/quintet/`,
`tools/rd2/`, `tools/mp2k/`, `tools/brownie/` and `tools/krawall/`. Run the
commands below from the repository root.

## Konami's driver

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `driver_emu.py` | runs the game's sound driver under the Unicorn ARM emulator: per-frame track output records, DirectSound mixer output, PSG register writes |
| `compare_trace.py` | diffs `supergbamidi --trace` against the emulated driver, frame by frame, for every song |
| `compare_notes.py` | checks a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against the emulated driver, note by note |
| `compare_audio.py` | compares two renders: loudness envelopes, spectra and level ratio |
| `test_song.py` | writes a copy of a ROM with a test song for commands and outputs that the game's songs may not use |

### Checking supergbamidi against Konami's driver

```sh
python tools/konami/compare_trace.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi        # the sequencer: every song, 12000 frames
build/supergbamidi -q -o rom rom.gba                                   # convert every song into rom/
python tools/konami/compare_notes.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi rom    # the conversion, note by note
python tools/konami/driver_emu.py rom.gba render-ds 10 3000 ref.wav    # the driver's sample mix, song 10
build/supergbamidi -q -o out -s 10 -t 4-15 rom.gba                     # the same tracks as MIDI + SF2
fluidsynth -ni -R 0 -C 0 -F mine.wav out/rom_10.sf2 out/rom_10.mid
python tools/konami/compare_audio.py ref.wav mine.wav
```

By default, converted notes follow the estimated beat and may be up to a
frame and a half from the driver's timing. `compare_notes.py` first makes a
temporary conversion with `--frame-timing`, placing each event on the
driver's frame. It checks that the original conversion has the same notes,
keys, programs, controller changes and pitch bends, in the same order on
each channel and within 1.65 frames of the temporary conversion: a frame and
a half, and the rounding of a tick. An event that gives a controller, pitch
bend or program the value it already has, as the conversions do where a loop
starts, isn't compared. The SoundFonts must be identical.

It then checks each note in the temporary conversion against the hardware
state left by the driver on the same frame: the note's start and stop,
the sample, duty cycle, wave or noise setting that plays, its pitch, its level
on each side and its echo send. If a MIDI track or an entire song is absent
from the conversion, the corresponding channel or song must also be silent in
the driver, and each track with notes has to stand for a different voice or
channel of the driver. It lists the differences and the largest pitch and
level deviations. PSG notes are written at their equal-tempered pitch, while
the driver's frequency table can only get within one step of the Game Boy's
11-bit frequency register, so that much is allowed for.

`render-ds` leaves the echo out unless you pass `--echo`, because MIDI can't
reproduce it, and fluidsynth's reverb and chorus are turned off to match.
`render-psg` covers the four PSG channels, and `--channel N` renders one of
them. `--voices` on `render-ds` renders chosen sample voices.

### Working out Konami's driver

In a GSF rip, `gsfopt` has zeroed every byte the songs never touched, which
makes the driver easy to isolate:

1. **Find the entry points.** In a GSF rip, the ripper's patch calls the
   driver's "play song" and "start song" routines. Main's IRQ table points at
   the VBlank handler, which calls the per-frame routine.
2. **Disassemble.** `gbadis.py` was run from those entry points. The per-frame
   routine's command dispatch gave the byte code, and the output stage showed
   how each track's record reaches the PSG registers and the DirectSound
   voices. The mixer was found as ARM code copied to IWRAM.
3. **Model and compare.** The sequencer was reimplemented from that reading. It
   was then compared, record for record, with the driver running in
   `driver_emu.py`, until the two matched, loops included.
4. **Check the audio.** The converted MIDI and SoundFonts were rendered and
   compared with the driver's mixer output, and with `psg_model.py`, for
   timing, pitch and level.

`driver_emu.py` picks the routine addresses by the ROM's game code. Those of
Yu-Gi-Oh! Ultimate Masters Edition: World Championship Tournament 2006 (`BY6J`,
`BY6E`), Shaman King: Master of Spirits 1 and 2 (`BSOE`, `B2ME`), Yu-Gi-Oh! Day
of the Duelist (`BY7E`), Yu-Gi-Oh! GX: Duel Academy (`BYGE`), Yu-Gi-Oh! World
Championship Tournament 2004 (`BYWP`), Rave Master: Special Attack Force
(`BRME`), Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelist Soul (`AY5E`), Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide
Edition (`AYWE`) and Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters (`AYDE`) are built in. For
another game, find the same routines, starting from the patterns in
`docs/konami.md`, and add them to `GAMES`. A game whose driver has the same code
as one of these usually places the routines at different addresses. Match
the code while ignoring literal pools and call targets. Read the init arguments
from the game's call to the init routine, and the RAM addresses from its literal
pools.

An entry in `GAMES` also says how many tracks and voices the driver has,
where the track output records are and where their pan bytes are, how the
mixer scales a voice's level, whether it has echo and which voices it takes
from echo bus 0, and whether a pitch change reloads the wave RAM. Those differ
in the older revisions of `BYWP`, `BRME`, `AY5E`, `AYWE` and `AYDE`, whose
output stage is part of the sequencer. `compare_trace.py` and `compare_notes.py`
then check them the same way as the others. In `AY5E` and `AYWE`, a voice has
one level for both sides, and the per-frame entry runs the mixer itself, which
fills a ring buffer as far as the DMA 1 interrupt has moved its position. The
emulator skips that call, and when it renders, it moves the position on and
runs the mixer itself.

`AYDE` has no mixer. Its DMA 1 and DMA 2 interrupt routines each mix two voices
into a FIFO, 16 samples at a time, and each FIFO plays at its timer's rate,
set by the last note started on it. When the emulator renders, it plays each
FIFO out at its timer's rate, runs the routine whenever a FIFO has 16 samples or
fewer left, and samples the two at 32768 Hz. `compare_notes.py` takes a voice's
pitch from its FIFO's timer period, and the entry says how its voice records and
sample table are laid out. Every write to a square channel restarts it,
including vibrato updates. The wave channel restarts only when it loads a new
wave. `compare_notes.py` therefore allows a PSG note to start on any frame that
writes to its channel. A note must start when a silent channel begins playing,
the wave changes or the noise restarts. DMA transfers into the sound registers,
such as `AYDE`'s wave RAM loads, count as register writes.

A game's songs may not use every command and output its driver has, so
`test_song.py` covers the others with a test song. It writes a copy of the ROM
with the test song in place of song 0. The script's docstring shows how to
check it.

## Rare's driver

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `driver_emu.py` | runs the game's sound driver under the Unicorn ARM emulator and records its note slots after each frame or renders the mixer's output |
| `compare_trace.py` | diffs `supergbamidi --trace` against the emulated driver, frame by frame, for every tune |
| `compare_notes.py` | checks a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against the emulated driver, note by note |
| `compare_audio.py` | compares two renders: loudness envelopes, spectra and level ratio |
| `test_song.py` | writes a copy of a ROM with a test song for commands and modes that the game's tunes may not use |

### Checking supergbamidi against Rare's driver

```sh
python tools/rare/compare_trace.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi     # the model: every tune, 12000 frames
build/supergbamidi -q -o rom rom.gba                              # convert every tune into rom/
python tools/rare/compare_notes.py rom.gba rom                    # the conversion, note by note
python tools/rare/driver_emu.py rom.gba render 10 3000 ref.wav    # the driver's output for tune 10
fluidsynth -ni -R 0 -C 0 -F mine.wav rom/rom_10.sf2 rom/rom_10.mid
python tools/rare/compare_audio.py ref.wav mine.wav
```

`compare_trace.py` runs `supergbamidi --trace` and the driver side by side, and
compares every note slot after each frame: its state, channel, keys, velocity,
envelope phase and level, instrument, and its position in the sample to a
2^23rd of a byte. It reports the first difference in each tune that has one.
`-j` compares several tunes at once.

`compare_notes.py` checks every note in a folder of MIDI files against what the
driver plays on the same frame: the note's start and release, its velocity, the
channel's volume, the sample that the SoundFont plays for it, and its pitch on
every frame, from the SoundFont zone's tuning and the channel's pitch bend. It
also checks the zone's envelope against the one that supergbamidi works out
from the instrument and the settings from controllers 20-23 (in the revision
that has them) that the driver's RAM held as each phase started. The MIDI file
keeps each event on its own tick, where the driver plays it on a frame, so it
allows a frame and a half of difference either way. It lists the differences
and the largest pitch deviation.

`driver_emu.py render` writes the driver's mono output at its own rate, and
`--channels` renders only the notes of the MIDI channels it names. The other
notes still count towards the mixer's limit of 8 voices, so the result is what
the game would play with those channels muted.

### Working out Rare's driver

The driver's init is easy to find in a ROM, because it copies the driver's ARM
code to IWRAM with a sequence that's the same in every revision (see
`docs/rare.md`). From there:

1. **Find the entry points.** The init stores the tune table's address and
   calls the routines that set the mix rate and the voice limit. The game calls
   the request routine with a tune number from many places, and the per-frame
   routine from one.
2. **Disassemble.** `gbadis.py` was run from those entry points, and with
   `--copy` it read the ARM code at the address the init copies it to. The
   sequencer's command table gave the byte code, and the mixer showed how each
   note's level and pitch are worked out.
3. **Model and compare.** The sequencer, the envelopes and the mixer's choice
   of voices were reimplemented from that reading. They were then compared,
   slot for slot, with the driver running in `driver_emu.py`, until the two
   matched, loops included.
4. **Check the conversion.** The converted MIDI files and SoundFonts were
   checked note by note with `compare_notes.py`, and rendered and compared with
   the driver's mixer output for timing, pitch and level.

`driver_emu.py` picks the routine and RAM addresses by the ROM's game code.
Those of *Donkey Kong Country* (`A5NE`), *Sabre Wulf* (`AWUE`), *It's Mr.
Pants* (`BPIE`), *Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge* (`BKZX`), *Donkey Kong
Country 2* (`B2DE`), *Banjo-Pilot* (`BAJE`) and *Donkey Kong Country 3*
(`BDQE`) are built in. For another game, find the same routines, starting from
the patterns in `docs/rare.md`, and add them to `GAMES`:

* `init`, `request` and `frame` are the init, the routine that requests a tune
  and the per-frame routine. In each of the games above, the request routine
  comes just before the init in ROM, and the per-frame routine a little after
  it.
* `tune`, `note_slots`, `fx_slots`, `buffer_flag`, `buffers` and
  `samples_per_frame` come from the per-frame routine and the mixer's literal
  pools: the tune playing, the note slots and sound effect records, the output
  buffer flag, the two words that hold the addresses of the output buffer's
  halves, and the samples a frame.
* `channel_volume`, the channels' controller 7 values, comes from the
  controller handler, and so does `envelope_settings` in a revision with
  controllers 20-23: the 4 bytes for each channel that they set.
* `slots_per_channel` and `fx_count` give the note slots each channel has and
  the number of sound effect records, if they aren't 6 and 5. The table at the
  start of `docs/rare.md` gives them for each checked game.

`driver_emu.py` identifies the mixer and the note-advance routine in IWRAM by
their code, so you don't need to supply their addresses.

A game's tunes may not use every command and mode its driver has, so
`test_song.py` covers the others with a test song. It writes a copy of the ROM
with the test song in place of tune 0. The script's docstring shows how to
check it.

## Quintet's driver

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `driver_emu.py` | runs the game's sound driver under the Unicorn ARM emulator: its writes to the sound, DMA and timer registers, each music channel's position and countdown, and a render of its output |
| `compare_trace.py` | diffs `supergbamidi --trace` against the emulated driver's register writes, frame by frame, for every song |
| `compare_notes.py` | checks a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against what the emulated driver plays, frame by frame |

### Checking supergbamidi against Quintet's driver

```sh
python tools/quintet/compare_trace.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi      # the model: every song, 12000 frames
build/supergbamidi -q -o rom rom.gba                                  # convert every song into rom/
python tools/quintet/compare_notes.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi rom  # the conversion, frame by frame
python tools/quintet/driver_emu.py rom.gba render 10 3000 ref.wav     # the driver's output for song 10
build/supergbamidi -q -l 1 -o out -s 10 rom.gba
fluidsynth -ni -R 0 -C 0 -F mine.wav out/rom_10.sf2 out/rom_10.mid
python tools/konami/compare_audio.py ref.wav mine.wav
```

`compare_trace.py` runs `supergbamidi --trace` and the driver side by side, and
compares every write the driver makes to the sound registers, DMA 1 and 2 and
timers 0 and 1, in order, starting with the play routine's. It leaves out the
bytes a FIFO start writes into the FIFO, which follow from the DMA's source. It
reports the first difference in each song that has one. `-j` compares several
songs at once.

`compare_notes.py` works out, from the driver's register writes, what each of
the 6 channels plays in each frame: whether it sounds, its level on each side,
its pitch, and its duty, wave pattern or sample. The PSG's envelope, length
counter and frequency sweep are modelled, and so is each FIFO's rate. It then
checks the MIDI file and the SoundFont against that, frame by frame: the
square and wave channels' frequency settings against the frequency table's
entry for each note's key, and the PCM channels' rates against the PCM pitch
table's, so that the tables' tuning, which the MIDI file leaves out, isn't
counted. A noise drum's sample includes the channel's volume, which is checked
frame by frame, allowing one step either way while the hardware envelope runs.
Since the MIDI file keeps each note on its own tick, up to a frame after the
driver's frame, each frame is compared with the same stretch of the note. A
note on a MIDI channel that the driver doesn't have, or one that starts after
all of the driver's channels have ended, counts as a difference.

`driver_emu.py render` writes the driver's stereo output at 32768 Hz: the PSG
through `psg_model.py`, and each FIFO's sample at its timer's rate.
`--channels` renders only the music channels it names, all four PSG channels,
one of them, or none, with any of the FIFOs.

### Working out Quintet's driver

The games keep the driver in one block of Thumb code, which their sound
routines call into. From there:

1. **Find the entry points.** The game's sound init calls the driver's init and
   gives it the game's files, its play-song routine looks up the music file
   and calls the driver's play routine with a song's address, and a short
   routine calls the per-frame routine.
2. **Disassemble.** `gbadis.py` was run from those entry points. The note
   reader's command table gave the byte code, and the output stage showed how
   the channels' register image reaches the hardware.
3. **Model and compare.** The driver was reimplemented from that reading, and
   compared, write for write, with the driver running in `driver_emu.py`,
   until the two matched, loops included. The J revision was then worked out
   by comparing each of its routines with the A revision's.
4. **Check the conversion.** The converted MIDI files and SoundFonts were
   checked frame by frame with `compare_notes.py`, and rendered and compared
   with the driver's output for timing, pitch and level.

`driver_emu.py` picks the addresses by the ROM's game code. Those of *Super
Robot Taisen A* (`ASRJ`), *D* (`A6SJ`), *R* (`AJ9J`) and *J* (`B6JJ`) are
built in. For another game, add an entry to `GAMES` with:

* `sound_init`, `play` and `frame`: the game's routines that call the
  driver's init and set up its files, play a song by number, and run the
  per-frame routine. The play-song routine is the one that calls the driver's
  play routine (see `docs/quintet.md`), and the other two are near it.
* `channels`: the table of the 6 music channel records' addresses, which the
  driver's play routine loads.
* `countdown`: the offset of the countdown in a channel's record, `0x18` in
  the A revision and `0x1A` in the J revision.

## Nintendo R&D2's driver

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `driver_emu.py` | runs the game's sound driver under the Unicorn ARM emulator: each voice's state and the PSG register writes, frame by frame, the players and tracks in use, and a render of the mixer's output |
| `compare_trace.py` | diffs `supergbamidi --trace` against the emulated driver's voices and PSG register writes, frame by frame, for every sequence |
| `compare_notes.py` | checks a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against the notes the emulated driver plays |
| `test_song.py` | copies a ROM and replaces sequence 0 with a test sequence for the commands and kinds of instrument that a game's sequences may not use |

### Checking supergbamidi against Nintendo R&D2's driver

```sh
python tools/rd2/compare_trace.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi      # the model: every sequence, 12000 frames
build/supergbamidi -q -o rom rom.gba                              # convert every sequence into rom/
python tools/rd2/compare_notes.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi rom  # the conversion, note by note
python tools/rd2/test_song.py rom.gba test.gba                    # the test sequence, as sequence 0

fluidsynth -ni -r 10512 -F mine.wav out/rom_05.sf2 out/rom_05.mid
python tools/konami/compare_audio.py ref.wav mine.wav
```

`compare_trace.py` runs `supergbamidi --trace` and the driver side by side.
After each frame it compares every field of each voice that plays, the order of
the mixer's list of sample voices, and every write to the PSG's registers. It
reports the first difference in each sequence that has one. `-j` compares
several sequences at once.

`compare_notes.py` runs the driver with hooks in its note on routine, which
give each note's track, key, velocity, voice, region and sample, and follows
each voice from frame to frame. Each note the driver plays has to be in the
MIDI file, and the other way round: on its track's channel, with the key and
velocity the conversion gives it, starting in the frame the driver starts it in
or the frame before, and ending within a frame of the driver's release or stop
of its voice. Notes that a track starts on the same key at the same time are
one MIDI note, the first's, which ends with the last of them, and a note that
its instrument has no region for, which the driver plays from its bank's table
of offsets, mustn't be in the MIDI file. Each note's SoundFont zone has to play
the driver's sample at the pitch the driver plays it at, to within a cent, and
while it's the newest note of its track, the MIDI file's pitch bend has to
follow its voice's pitch, frame by frame. A sequence named in `--songs` that has
no MIDI file mustn't play any notes.

`driver_emu.py render` writes the mixer's stereo output at 10512 Hz: the 8-bit
samples the driver sends to the FIFOs, without the PSG. `--tracks` mutes the
player's other tracks with their mute flags, so that a track's output can be
compared with a render of `supergbamidi -t` alone.

### Working out Nintendo R&D2's driver

The driver is a block of Thumb code, with three ARM routines that its init
copies to IWRAM. From there:

1. **Find the entry points.** The game's sound init calls the driver's init
   with the game's settings, and the game's VBlank handler calls the driver's
   VBlank routine and its per-frame routine. The game's play-music routine
   requests a sequence for a player, and its per-frame sound routine hands the
   requests over.
2. **Disassemble.** `gbadis.py` was run from those entry points. The track
   reader's command table gave the byte code, and the voice routines showed
   how the mixer and PSG play each voice.
3. **Model and compare.** The driver was reimplemented from that reading, and
   compared voice for voice with the driver running in `driver_emu.py`, until
   the two matched, loops included.
4. **Check the conversion.** The converted MIDI files and SoundFonts were
   checked note by note with `compare_notes.py`, and track by track against
   the driver's renders for timing and level.

`driver_emu.py` picks the addresses by the ROM's game code. Those of *The
Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords* (`AZLE`) and *Super Mario
Advance 2: Super Mario World* (`AA2E`), which has an older revision of the
driver, are built in. For another game, add an entry to `GAMES` with:

* `sound_init`: the game's routine that calls the driver's init with its
  settings.
* `request` and `commit`: the driver's routines that request a sequence for a
  player and hand the requests over (see `docs/rd2.md`).
* `vblank`, `frame` and `requests`: the driver's VBlank routine, its per-frame
  routine, and the per-frame routine's first step, which carries out the
  requests.
* `voices`, `active`, `tracks`, `players` and `fixed_region`: the driver's
  voices, its list of the sample voices that play, its tracks and players, and
  its region in RAM for instruments with a sample for each key.
* `outputs` and `output_index`: the output buffers, and the variable that picks
  the one the mixer writes.
* `note_on`, `note_key`, `note_voice` and `note_done`: the note on routine, and
  the points in it where it has added the transpose, found a voice, and set the
  voice's sample.
* `active_end`, `music_player`, `player_size`, `player_playing`, `voice_note`
  and `voice_velocity`, where the game's revision of the driver differs from A
  Link to the Past's: what the last voice of the mixer's list links to, the
  player the game plays its music on, the size of a player's record and the
  offset of its byte that is 1 while it plays, and the offsets of a voice's note
  and velocity. In the Super Mario Advance 2 revision, the mixer's list ends
  with a node, the music player is 0x13, a player's record is 0x44 bytes, and a
  voice keeps the velocity at 0x09 and no note.

The emulator reads 0 from memory outside the GBA's, as `supergbamidi` does,
where a region read from a bank's table of offsets can find the address of its
sample. `test_song.py` pads a ROM that ends before its free
space with 0xFF, and writes the test sequence in the form of the game's
revision.

## MP2K

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `driver_emu.py` | runs the game's MP2K driver under the Unicorn ARM emulator and records its sound channels after each frame, or renders the mixer's output |
| `compare_trace.py` | diffs `supergbamidi --trace` against the emulated driver, frame by frame, for every song |
| `compare_notes.py` | checks a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against the emulated driver, note by note |

### Checking supergbamidi against MP2K

```sh
python tools/mp2k/compare_trace.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi     # the model: every song, 12000 frames
build/supergbamidi -q -o rom rom.gba                              # convert every song into rom/
python tools/mp2k/compare_notes.py rom.gba rom                    # the conversion, note by note
python tools/mp2k/driver_emu.py rom.gba render 10 3000 ref.wav    # the driver's DirectSound output for song 10
```

`compare_trace.py` runs `supergbamidi --trace` and the driver side by side, and
compares every sound channel that plays after each frame: its status, track,
keys, velocity, priority, envelope level and volumes, then a DirectSound
channel's rate, sample, and position in it to a 2^23rd of a point, or a PSG
channel's frequency setting, envelope goal and counter, sustain level, outputs
and wave. It reports the first difference in each song that has one. `-j`
compares several songs at once.

`compare_notes.py` checks every note the driver starts against the MIDI file:
the note's start and release, its velocity, its track's volume, the sound that
the SoundFont zone plays for it, and its pitch on every frame until its
release, from the zone's tuning and the channel's pitch bend. It reads the
driver's channels just before the PSG routine runs in each frame, when the
notes that the tracks started in the frame still have their start flag. A note
whose envelope never rises above 0 doesn't count. A PSG square or wave note can
be two steps of the 11-bit frequency register from equal temperament (see
`docs/mp2k.md`), and that much is allowed for. A sample without a loop that
runs out stops its channel, which can happen between ticks, so then the MIDI
note can end as late as the first tick after it. When a track changes its pitch
in a tick in which it starts a note, the driver leaves the track's older notes
behind until its next change, while the MIDI file bends them all, so an older
note's pitch isn't compared until the driver catches it up. Track 9 plays on
the drum channel, so its zones come from bank 128. A synth voice of Camelot's
mixer has to play the SoundFont's sample for its wave, and for a pulse or saw
wave, the sample made for the key the driver plays it at, whose pitch is the
driver's rate for that key. A song named in `--songs` that has no MIDI file
mustn't play any notes. It needs a conversion made without `--voice-channels`,
so that each MIDI channel holds one track.

`driver_emu.py render` writes the DirectSound mixer's stereo output at its own
rate, with the same output on both sides for a mono mixer. It leaves the PSG
channels out. `--tracks` mixes only the notes of the tracks it names, and the
others still take up channels, so the result is what the game would play with
those tracks muted. Camelot's mixer's output has its echo in it, and a muted
track's channels go into sums of their own, since the mixer leaves out a silent
channel, which then doesn't move on through its sample.

### Working out MP2K

The driver's routines have the names of the SDK's m4a library, and the
patterns that `supergbamidi` finds them by are in `docs/mp2k.md`:

1. **Find the entry points.** `m4aSongNumStart` has the same code in every
   version, apart from two registers that some games' compiler swaps, and its
   literal pool gives the song table and the music player table.
   `m4aSoundMain`, which calls the driver's main routine, comes just before it,
   and `m4aSoundInit`, which sets the driver's mode, a little before that.
   `m4aSoundVSync` restarts the sound DMA each frame. Where the compiler swaps
   the registers, it's compiled from C: `push {lr}`, then loads of the address
   at `0x03007FF0` and of the structure's ID.
2. **Model and compare.** The sequencer, the choice of channels, the
   envelopes and the mixer's progress through each sample were reimplemented
   from the driver's code. They were then compared, channel for channel, with
   the driver running in `driver_emu.py`, until the two matched.
3. **Check the conversion.** The converted MIDI files and SoundFonts were
   checked note by note with `compare_notes.py`.

`driver_emu.py` picks the routine addresses by the ROM's game code. Those of
*Pokémon Emerald* (`BPEE`), *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four
Swords* (`AZLE`), whose Four Swords half and menus use MP2K, *The Legend of
Zelda: The Minish Cap* (`BZME`), *Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories* (`B8CE`),
*Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2* (`B2RE`) and *Golden Sun: The Lost
Age* (`AGFE`) are built in. For
another game, find the same routines and tables, and add them to `GAMES`:
`init`, `song_start`, `main` and `vsync` are `m4aSoundInit`,
`m4aSongNumStart`, `m4aSoundMain` and `m4aSoundVSync`, and `song_table` and
`player_table` come from `m4aSongNumStart`'s literal pool. The emulator finds
the driver's state, its channels and the PSG routine from the structure whose
address the init stores at `0x03007FF0`.

`AGFE`'s entry runs Camelot's version under `CamelotEmulator`, which does what
the game does around the driver (see `docs/mp2k.md`): it copies the mixer to
IWRAM before the init, and each frame it runs Camelot's `m4aSoundVSync`, copies
the DMA counter, runs Camelot's `SoundMain` and then the output stage. Three
GBA behaviours need special handling in Unicorn:

* Camelot calls routines with `mov lr, rN` and the second half of a `bl` alone,
  which the ARM7 runs as a jump to LR. Unicorn's cores either take it for half
  of a Thumb-2 instruction or switch to ARM mode, so each such call in the code
  is changed to `blx lr`, which does the same.
* The mixer writes instructions into its loops, which the ARM7 runs at once.
  Unicorn runs translations of the code, so each write to the mixer's code
  drops the translations it changes, and a new translation starts just before
  the fixed-pitch loop, whose first pass would otherwise run the old code.
* The mixer has DMA3 copy a frame's points of a sample to the stack, so a
  write that starts DMA3 at once does the copy.

The output stage writes two 8-bit points for each mixed point, which add up to
a 9-bit point, at twice the mix rate; `render` averages them.

## Brownie Brown's driver

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `driver_emu.py` | runs the game's sound driver under the Unicorn ARM emulator: its writes to the sound registers, each sound channel's record and each mixer voice's or FIFO's sample, its variables, and a render of its output |
| `compare_trace.py` | diffs `supergbamidi --trace` against the emulated driver, frame by frame, for every sound |
| `compare_notes.py` | checks a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against what the emulated driver plays, frame by frame |

### Checking supergbamidi against Brownie Brown's driver

```sh
python tools/brownie/compare_trace.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi -j 4  # the model: every sound, 12000 frames
build/supergbamidi -q -o rom rom.gba                                   # convert every sound into rom/
python tools/brownie/compare_notes.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi rom   # the conversion, frame by frame
python tools/brownie/driver_emu.py rom.gba render 10 3000 ref.wav --channels 8,9,10,11,12
build/supergbamidi -q -l 1 -o out -s 10 -t 8-12 rom.gba               # the same channels as MIDI + SF2
fluidsynth -ni -R 0 -C 0 -r 32768 -F mine.wav out/rom_010.sf2 out/rom_010.mid
python tools/konami/compare_audio.py ref.wav mine.wav
```

`compare_trace.py` runs `supergbamidi --trace` and the driver side by side, and
compares, frame by frame, every write the driver makes to the sound registers,
in order, each sound channel's record, each mixer voice's or FIFO's sample, and
the driver's other variables. It reports the first difference in each sound
that has one. `-j` compares several sounds at once.

As with Konami's driver, the default conversion follows the estimated beat.
`compare_notes.py` makes a second conversion with `--frame-timing` and
checks that the original matches it, allowing 1.65 frames of timing
difference per event: a frame and a half, and the rounding of a tick. It
then checks the second conversion against the driver.

`compare_notes.py` works out what each channel plays in each frame: for the PSG
channels, from the driver's register writes, with the PSG's envelope, length
counter and frequency sweep modelled, and with a sound effect's channel taking
its PSG channel from the music; and for the sample channels, from the voices as
the per-frame routine leaves them, while the mixer runs and mixes them, or in
the *Magical Vacation* revision from the FIFOs' samples, while their timers
run. It then checks the MIDI file and the SoundFont against that, frame by
frame: the square and wave channels' frequency settings against the frequency
table's entry for each note's key, in a zone tuned as the table is; a sample
channel's sample, its length and loop, and the rate the mixer or the timer
plays it at; and each channel's levels. A noise drum's sample includes the
channel's volume, which is checked frame by frame, allowing one step either way
while the hardware envelope runs. A sound channel plays one note at a time, so a
MIDI note that still sounds when the next one on its channel starts counts as a
difference, and so does a note on a MIDI channel that stands for none of the
sound channels. A sound named in `--songs` that has no MIDI file mustn't play
anything.

`driver_emu.py render` writes the driver's stereo output at 32768 Hz: the PSG
through `psg_model.py`, with the hardware's envelope, length counter and sweep,
and the FIFOs' points from the frame their DMA starts in, or in the *Magical
Vacation* revision each FIFO's points at its timer's rate, on both sides.
`--channels` keeps the PSG channels it names, all four, one or none, and the
sample channels all together or not at all.

### Working out Brownie Brown's driver

The driver is ARM code, with its mixer copied to IWRAM:

1. **Find the entry points.** The game's VBlank handler calls a Thumb routine
   that calls the per-frame routine, and the IRQ table that the game copies to
   RAM points the DMA 1 and DMA 2 interrupts at the mixer. The game's other
   sound routines, which queue a sound and start the fades, are Thumb routines
   just before the driver's tables.
2. **Disassemble.** `gbadis.py` was run from the per-frame routine and the
   mixer, with an `A` before each address for ARM code, and with `--copy` it
   read the mixer's code at its address in IWRAM. The command table gave the
   byte code, and the mixer showed how the voices move through their samples.
3. **Model and compare.** The per-frame routine, the fades, the queue and the
   mixer's progress through each sample were reimplemented from that reading,
   and compared with the driver running in `driver_emu.py`, until the two
   matched, the routine's `r5` included, which `ED` writes to a register.
4. **Check the conversion.** The converted MIDI files and SoundFonts were
   checked frame by frame with `compare_notes.py`, and rendered and compared
   with the driver's output.

The *Magical Vacation* revision turned up when the patterns that detection
reads were searched for in the game: all of them matched but the per-frame
routine's start, which pushes `r8` too, and the routine's loop counts 12
channels. A diff of the two revisions' per-frame routines, instruction by
instruction with the addresses masked, showed what changed, and the Thumb
routines that call the driver, just before its frequency table, led through
veneers to its init, its queue, its fade out and the two interrupt routines
that feed the FIFOs.

`driver_emu.py` picks the addresses by the ROM's game code. Those of *Sword of
Mana* (`AVSE`) and *Magical Vacation* (`AMVJ`) are built in. For another game,
add an entry to `GAMES` with:

* `channel_count` and `voice_count`: the channels that the per-frame routine
  runs, and the mixer's voices or the FIFOs.
* `init`, `request` and `frame`: the driver's init, the routine that queues a
  sound, and the per-frame routine, all in ARM.
* `mixer` and `copies`: the mixer's address in IWRAM, and the copies the game
  makes of it from the ROM, as (source, destination, size); or for the
  *Magical Vacation* revision, `interrupts`: the DMA 1 and DMA 2 interrupt
  routines, which feed FIFO A and FIFO B, and no copies.
* `channels`, `voices`, `fifos` and `variables`: the channel records, the
  voices or the FIFOs' samples, the 32 bytes of the mixer's points for the
  FIFOs, and the stretches of the driver's variables: from the queue to the
  voices, or the queue and then SOUNDCNT_L's copy and the fade.

In the *Magical Vacation* revision, the harness plays each FIFO at its timer's
rate after each frame's routine: at each overflow, the FIFO plays a point, and
if it then holds 16 or fewer, the harness runs the FIFO's interrupt routine,
which gives it the next 4 points or stops the timer. It notes the channel whose
note starts each timer from the routine's `r7`.

The emulator starts each call with `r0`-`r12` at 0, so that what `ED` writes
from `r5` is the same as in the model.

## Krawall

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `driver_emu.py` | runs the game's build of Krawall under the Unicorn ARM emulator: the mixer's variables, the player's record, each of the module's channels and each mixer channel, and a render of its output |
| `compare_trace.py` | diffs `supergbamidi --trace` against the emulated player, frame by frame, for every module |
| `compare_notes.py` | checks a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against what the emulated player plays, tick by tick |
| `test_song.py` | writes a copy of a game with hand-made modules for the parts of the player that the game's modules may not use |

### Checking supergbamidi against Krawall

```sh
python tools/krawall/compare_trace.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi -j 4  # the model: every module, 12000 frames
build/supergbamidi -q -o rom rom.gba                                   # convert every module into rom/
python tools/krawall/compare_notes.py rom.gba build/supergbamidi rom   # the conversion, tick by tick
python tools/krawall/test_song.py rom.gba test.gba                     # modules with every effect
python tools/krawall/compare_trace.py test.gba build/supergbamidi --songs N-M  # the last 3 that --info lists
python tools/krawall/driver_emu.py rom.gba render ADDRESS 3000 ref.wav  # a module's address, from --info
```

`compare_trace.py` runs `supergbamidi --trace` and the game's code side by side,
and compares, frame by frame, the mixer's variables (the master volumes, the
mixer's quality settings, the sound timer's step and count, the music's volume
and the count of plays), the player's record, each of the module's channels and
each mixer channel, in hex as Krawall keeps them in RAM, whenever they change.
It reports the first difference in each module that has one. `-j` compares
several modules at once.

`compare_notes.py` runs the game's code and reads the module channels after
each player tick, from a hook where the mixer's worker resumes. For each
active mixer channel still owned by the module channel's last note, it
records the sample, position, step and levels, plus position changes made by
`kramSetPos()`. It derives notes from that state in the same way as the
converter, then checks the MIDI and SoundFont tick by tick. Note starts and
ends must be within a millisecond on the correct MIDI channel. The preset
must match the sample data, loop and start offset. Pitch must be within 5
cents, and CC10 and CC11 within one step of the values needed for the
recorded levels.

`test_song.py` adds three modules after the game's data, which the module scan
lists after the game's modules: one with Amiga periods and every effect of the
effect column, the same patterns with S3M's fast volume slides, and one with
linear frequencies, XM instruments with envelopes, fades and vibratos, and the
volume column's effects. They play three samples of their own, which loop
forwards, back and forth or not at all, and the copy points the player's
literals at new tables of samples and instruments, so that the game's modules
play as before.

`driver_emu.py render` writes the mixer's 8-bit stereo output at the mixer's
rate. It names a module by the address of its header, which `--info` lists.

### Working out Krawall

The player is Thumb code in ROM, and the mixer is ARM code in IWRAM:

1. **Find the entry points.** The library's version string is in the ROM, and
   the game's sound init calls `kragInit()`, `kramSetMasterVol()` and
   `kramQualityMode()`, which lead to the timers' setup and the sound timer.
   The game's routine that starts a module calls `krapPlay()` with a module
   from its table, and its VBlank handler calls the worker, `kramWorker()`,
   in IWRAM. The game's start-up code copies the library's IWRAM code and data,
   and its EWRAM data, from the ROM.
2. **Disassemble.** `gbadis.py` was run from `krapPlay()` and the player's
   tick, and with `--copy` from the worker and the mixer's routines at their
   addresses in IWRAM. The tables of effects gave each effect's routines.
3. **Model and compare.** The player, the effects and the mixer's progress
   through each sample were reimplemented from that reading, and compared with
   the game's code running in `driver_emu.py`, until every byte of the records
   matched, then checked with `test_song.py`'s modules for the parts that the
   game's modules may not use.
4. **Check the conversion.** The converted MIDI files and SoundFonts were
   checked tick by tick with `compare_notes.py`, and rendered and compared with
   the game's output.

`driver_emu.py` picks the addresses by the ROM's game code. Those of *Digimon
Racing* (`BDGE`) are built in. For another game with the same build, add an
entry to `GAMES` with:

* `iwram` and `ewram`: the ROM's copies of the library's IWRAM code and data
  and of its EWRAM data, which the game's start-up code makes, as (source,
  size).
* `sound_init`, `play`, `worker` and `dma_address`: the game's sound init, which
  calls `kragInit()`, `kramSetMasterVol()` and `kramQualityMode()`,
  `krapPlay()`, `kramWorker()` and `getDmaAddress()`, which the harness replaces
  with a routine that hands the worker the same two buffers and a frame's
  samples each time.
* `after_tick` and `set_pos`: where the worker goes on after a tick, and
  `kramSetPos()`, for `compare_notes.py`.
* `frame_samples`, `player`, `mixer`, `master`, `timer`, `music_volume` and
  `plays`: the samples of a frame, and the addresses of the player's record,
  the mixer's channels, the master volumes, the sound timer's step and count,
  the music's volume and the count of plays.

`test_song.py` also needs, in its `GAMES`, the game's table of samples and its
count, and the player's literals that give the tables of samples and
instruments.
