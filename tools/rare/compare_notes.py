"""Check a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against the game's driver, note by note.

    compare_notes.py ROM FOLDER [--songs 0-22] [--frames 12000]

FOLDER holds supergbamidi's conversion of ROM: NAME_NN.mid and NAME_NN.sf2 for each song, or NAME_rare_NN.mid and
NAME_rare_NN.sf2 if detection finds another of the game's drivers first. For every song, the driver runs under
driver_emu.py for as long as the MIDI file lasts, and each note it plays is matched with a MIDI note on the same channel
and key that starts within a frame and a half of it. For each pair, the script checks:

  - the velocity, and the channel's volume when the note starts;
  - the sample: the SoundFont zone that the note's program and key choose has to play the driver's sample;
  - the pitch on every frame of the note, from the zone's root key, tuning and sample rate and the channel's pitch bend,
    against the step the driver moves the sample on by;
  - the release, which has to come within a frame and a half of the MIDI note's end, unless the MIDI file ends the note
    earlier because the key starts again there.

A MIDI note that the driver doesn't play, or a driver note that the MIDI file doesn't have, counts as a difference. MIDI
events land on their own ticks, where the driver plays them at the start of the frame that reaches them, so a difference
of a frame and a half either way is allowed.
