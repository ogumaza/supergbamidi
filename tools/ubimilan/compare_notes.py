"""Check a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against Ubisoft Milan's driver, note by note.

    compare_notes.py ROM SUPERGBAMIDI FOLDER [--songs 0-13] [--frames 12000]

FOLDER holds supergbamidi's conversion of ROM: NAME_NN.mid and NAME_NN.sf2 for each piece of music, or
NAME_ubimilan_NN.mid and NAME_ubimilan_NN.sf2 if another driver was detected first. Events in these MIDI files follow
the song's beat and may be up to a frame and a half from the driver's timing. The script converts ROM again with
--frame-timing to keep events on the driver's frames. Both conversions must have identical SoundFonts and the same
notes, keys and programs, in the same order on each channel and within 1.65 frames of each other: the frame and a
half, and the rounding of a tick. It then runs the driver under driver_emu.py for every frame of the --frame-timing
MIDI file, and each sample that the driver starts on a voice must be a note on MIDI channel 10:

  - starting on the frame on which the driver starts the sample;
  - at the velocity that the voice's volume gives: 127 times the volume over 64, a sample's full scale;
  - with a zone for its key, in the preset of its program in bank 128, whose sample holds the driver's points at the
    rate the mixer plays them, and loops where the driver's does;
  - ending on the frame on which the driver stops the voice, or on the frame after the one in which the voice reaches
    the end of a sample without a loop, or with the file.

A sample that the driver starts at volume 0 plays nothing, and the MIDI file leaves it out. A key of channel 9 outside
its kit makes the driver play a sample from a mirror of the ROM, which the MIDI file leaves out too; those are counted.
The PSG's notes that sound, from the driver's writes to NR12, NR22, NR32 and NR42, must match the MIDI file's notes on
channels 1 to 3 and on channel 10's keys up to 11, frame for frame.
