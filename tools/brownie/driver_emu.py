"""Run Brownie Brown's GBA sound driver under the Unicorn ARM emulator.

This is the reference for checking supergbamidi's model of the driver. It calls the driver's init, its request routine
and its per-frame routine (no BIOS, no video), and the routines that the game's DMA 1 and DMA 2 interrupts call. In the
Sword of Mana revision, it copies the driver's mixer to IWRAM and runs it once for each 16 points the FIFOs play. In
the Magical Vacation revision, each FIFO plays a sample at the rate its timer sets, and a FIFO that holds 16 points or
fewer after playing one asks for more, which runs the interrupt routine that gives it the sample's next 4 points. It
captures what the driver does:

    trace       after each frame, the frame's writes to the sound registers (w), each sound channel's record that's
                in use (c), each voice that isn't clear (v), the mixer's voices or the FIFOs' samples, and the driver's
                other variables when they change (g), the records and variables in hex as the driver keeps them
    render      the sound: the PSG through psg_model.py, and the FIFOs' 8-bit samples

    driver_emu.py ROM trace SONG FRAMES
    driver_emu.py ROM render SONG FRAMES OUT.wav [--channels 0,8]

The routine and RAM addresses are chosen by the ROM's game code. Those of Sword of Mana (AVSE) and Magical Vacation
(AMVJ) are built in. Another game needs its own values; see GAMES and docs/brownie.md.
