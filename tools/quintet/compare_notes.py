"""Check a conversion's MIDI files and SoundFonts against the game's driver, frame by frame.

    compare_notes.py ROM SUPERGBAMIDI FOLDER [--songs 0-22] [--frames 12000]

FOLDER holds supergbamidi's conversion of ROM: NAME_NN.mid and NAME_NN.sf2 for each song, or NAME_quintet_NN.mid and
NAME_quintet_NN.sf2 if detection finds another of the game's drivers first. For every song, the driver runs under
driver_emu.py for as long as the MIDI file lasts, or until all of its channels have ended, and the script works out from
its register writes what each of the 6 channels plays in each frame. The MIDI file and the SoundFont have to play the
same, channel by channel:

  - the frames in which the channel sounds;
  - its pitch: on a square or wave channel, the frequency setting against the one the note's key stands for in the
    driver's frequency table, and on a PCM channel, the rate its FIFO plays at against the one the key stands for in
    the driver's PCM pitch table (the MIDI files keep equal temperament, so the tables' tuning is left out);
  - its level on each side, which CC10 and CC11 carry, to within 1.5 dB;
  - its waveform: a square's duty, the wave channel's 32 or 64 steps, or the bytes of a PCM sample.

A MIDI note on a channel that the driver doesn't have, or one that starts after all of the driver's channels have
ended, counts as a difference.

The noise channel's drums are rendered into the SoundFont from the driver's writes to its registers, so for it the sides
are checked, and the volume that the drum's sample has at each frame against the channel's. While the channel's
envelope runs, a step either way is allowed, since the envelope steps on a clock that isn't tied to the frames.

MIDI notes land on their own ticks, where the driver plays them at the start of the frame that reaches them, and each
frame's changes come as far into the frame as the note's start. So each frame of the driver is compared with that
stretch of the MIDI file, or failing that, with the MIDI file anywhere from half a frame before the frame to half a
frame after the next. The MIDI file is timed as a player plays it, at tempos of whole microseconds a quarter note,
which can put a note a little ahead of the driver's frames or behind them, so a note that starts that close to a
frame's start may belong to the end of the frame before. SUPERGBAMIDI is used for its --info report, which names the
driver's tables.
